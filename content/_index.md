       The focus of my PhD project is the investigation of properties of low-rank neural networks and in effective memory-efficient ways to train or fine-tune them. Connected to this, I also recently gained interest in mechanisms of feature learning in deep networks, with a particular focus on the emergence of low-dimensional structures during training.
       In this page I keep a collection of my most recent works together with some selected projects and Demos.
